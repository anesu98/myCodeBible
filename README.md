There are many, many websites dedicated to technically explaining how to code and this
project is not one of them. 

The aim is just to have some place to refer to when I code that's; easily accessible, has 
all the extra information that I need because it can have links to where I learnt it from to explain 
that thing again incase I need some clarification and that's easy to manipulate (I want the flexibility of 
moving information around to get the best possible options to maximize my workflow)

This project was created due to my notebooks and pens running out whilst I've been taking notes. Plus, going 
through the agony of shifting through my many notebooks, which some of them have got lost pages in them (because I 
bought some shitty notebooks at first...) and the whole situation just wasn't exactly ideal....

SO, for this reason, I thought it could be cool to practice my skills by creating essentially a
digital notebook of all the stuff I've learnt whilst programming and putting it into a neat little
website that I can obviosly update often. Meaning I can do some design work when I'm inspired and work on my front
end skills, I would be building my confidence because I would litterally be coding everyday whilst learning to code, etc.



I'm hoping that by that this project expands beyond just web development, but can span into the many different disciplines
of software engineering.

The beauty of this is that I can even add in a dictionary for stuff like Photoshop and etc.
